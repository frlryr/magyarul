# Introduction
## Orthophony, Orthoepy
* The Hungarian language has:
    * 7 different sounds
    * Each can be either long¹ or short²
    * It produces 14 different forms of characters: vowels
    * And 24 different articulations, marked by as many consonants
* The vowels are:
    * a, e, i o, ö, u, ü.
* The protacted vowel equivalents are:
    * á, é, í, ó, ő³, ú, ű³
* On the equivalent and non-equivalent English articulations of compounded vowels
    * a is articulated like French's a in fatalité
    * á is articulated like English's a in Father
    * e is articulated like English's a in fat. In monosyllables its softened if not
        followed by m or a sharp consonant. Same in the words tenni, enni, menni, venni
        and similar ones
    * é is articulated like English's a in fate, if the assonance of e be avoided
    * i is articulated like French's i in fine
    * í is articulated like English's long e in deed
    * o is articulated like French's short o. Is the short sound of ó
    * ó is articulated like English's o in coal, loan, etc.
    * ö is articulated like French's eu in jeudi. A very deep and unclear sound of a
        short e
    * ő is articulated like German's ö in öde, höle, etc. Is the protracted sound of ö
    * u is articulated like English's u in bull
    * ú is articulated like English's long double o in food
    * ü is articulated like French's u in une, (je) fus, etc.
    * ű is articulated like German's ü in übel. Is the protracted sound of ü.
* The 24 consonants are:
    * b, cs, cz, d, f, g, gy, h, j, k, l, ly, m, n, ny, p, r, s, sz, t, ty, v, z, zs
    * B, Cs, Cz, D, F, G, Gy, H, J, K, L, Ly, M, N, Ny, P, R, S, Sz, T, Ty, V, Z, Zs
* Of which 16 are simple⁴:
    * b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, z
* And 8 are compounded⁵:
    * cs, cz, gy, ly, ny, sz, ty, zs.
* On the non-equivalent English articulations of compounded consonants⁶:
    * cz is articulated like ts in English, equal to the German z
    * gy is articulated by d followed by u as in due, duce, etc.
    * dj is articulated by d followed by y as in English
    * ly is articulated similarly to French's il, ille, etc. preceded by another vowel
        as in traveil, feuille, etc.
    * lj is articulated similarly to ly, but has been replaced by jj as in vajjon,
        instead of valljon
    * ny is articulated like in French's gne, and the English n with long u, or the n in
        new
    * ty is articulated as a sharp gy, and very nearly to the articulation of the
        consonants t and u, as in tube.
    * dzs is articulated like g in general.
* The Hungarian language requires that:
    * Each articulation and sound to be given distinctly and plainly
    * There is no muted vowel or unarticulated consonant in any word
    * Even in the ocurrence of two consonants be distinct. Each being articulated
        separately
* Here is a cheatsheet for quicker learning:

NOTE:
    ¹ By long is meant the protraction or prolongation.
    ² By short is meant contraction, or quick pronunciation of the same sound.
    ³ There is a older form accent: umlaut(?). This one is modern.
    ⁴ They have the same articulations as English. Except j who equals y as a consonant,
        s who equals to sh, g who is always hard like [g]uide, and r who always have a
        strong trill.
    ⁵ There are 3 articulations in English that are identical to Hungarian ones. cs who
        equals to [ch]apter, the sz who equals to sharp [s]even, and zs who equals to
        sei[z]ure.
    ⁶ These require training as they're not exactly equal. And thus the most difficult
        articulations are those of gy and ty. The latter being a sharp articulation of
        the former.

## Division of the sounds and words
* To facilitate Etymological formations, Grammarians have assumed the division of vowels
    into hard and soft ones:
    * hard sound being: a, á, o, ó, u, ú
    * soft sound being: e, é, i¹, ö, ő, ü, ű
* If a word has both vowel classes, hard vowels dominate, making it a hard word;
    otherwise, its a soft word.
* While í is between hard and soft, a word is soft if í predominates or is the only
    vowel.

NOTE:
    ¹ The long i may be considered as a medium sound between hard and soft.

## Assimilation of sounds and articulation
* Hungarian affixes adapt to the root word through vowel harmony (matching vowels: a/e,
    o/ö, u/ü) and consonant assimilation (adjusting consonants for smoother
    pronunciation).
* The corresponding vowel pairs are a/e, o/ö, u/ü—so knowing one affix reveals the
    other. For instance: In várunk (we wait), the root vár takes -unk as the affix. A
    soft-vowel root like ül (to sit) takes -ünk, forming ülünk (we sit). Similarly,
    házam (my house) uses -am, while the soft-vowel szék (chair) takes -em, forming
    székem (my chair).
* Consonants in verb conjugation assimilate to the root, just as vowels in affixes do:
    * j → sz if the root ends in sz: másszon (he may creep) instead of mássjon.
    * j → z if the root ends in z: hozzon (he may bring) instead of hozjon.
    * j → s in three cases:
        1. If the root ends in s: ásson (he may dig) instead of ásjon.
        2. If the root ends in t after a long vowel or consonant: tanítson (he may
            teach) instead of tanítjon.
        3. If the root ends in t after a short vowel, t → s: fusson (he may run) from
            futjon.
    This keeps pronunciation smoother and more natural.
* Demonstrative pronouns (ez = this, az = that) assimilate their z to the following
    affix’s consonant:
    * az-ról → arról (off that)
    * ez-ből → ebből (out of this)
    * ez-képen → ekképen (thus)
* Similarly, the affixes -val/-vel (with)¹ and -vá/-vé (into) assimilate their v to the
    final consonant of the root:
    * kéz-vel → kézzel (with the hand)
    * az-vá → azzá (into that)
    * fegyver-vel → fegyverrel (with arms)

NOTE:
    ¹ Both avval/evvel and azzal/ezzel (with that/this) are correct, but the latter is
        preferred.

## Pronlogation of the vowels
* The short final vowels a and e are usually prolonged when a word takes any affix:
    * ruha (dress) → ruhám (my dress), ruhát (dress - objective case), ruhával (with a
        dress).
* This prolongation applies across all grammatical forms.
* If an affix ending in a or e takes another affix, the vowel is further accentuated:
    * ruhája (his dress) → ruhájával (with his dress).
* No prolongation occurs before the affixes -i, -ság, -kor, -kép, -ként:
    * atyai (fatherly), gyávaság (cowardice).
* Before the affixes -é, -ig, -ért, -úl, the prolongation is optional:
    * hazáért / hazaért (for the fatherland), atyául / atyaúl (like a father).
* Some words undergo root vowel lengthening in their formation, which is an etymological
    process:
    * szőni (to weave) from szövni, lőni (to shoot) from lövni.

## Contractions
* Contractions in Hungarian occur when words take affixes, usually by abbreviating the
    final syllable. This is done by:
    * Shortening the long vowel of the final syllable.
    * Dropping the short consonant of the final syllable.
    However, contractions don’t happen if the final syllable ends with a double
    consonant, or if the final consonants of the last and penultimate syllables are
    similar but not easily articulated together. Consonants like l, m, n, r, cs, cz, sz,
    z combine easily, especially with palatals and dentals:
    dolog-ot → dolgot (the thing)
    * járom-at → jármat (the yoke)
    * tükör-öt → tükröt (the mirror)
    * hajol-om → hajlom (I stoop)
