# Introduction
## Orthophony, Orthoepy
* The Hungarian language has:
    * 7 different sounds
    * Each can be either long¹ or short²
    * It produces 14 different forms of characters: vowels
    * And 24 different articulations, marked by as many consonants
* The vowels are:
    * a, e, i o, ö, u, ü.
* The protacted vowel equivalents are:
    * á, é, í, ó, ő³, ú, ű³
* On the equivalent and non-equivalent English articulations of compounded vowels
    * a is articulated like French's a in fatalité
    * á is articulated like English's a in Father
    * e is articulated like English's a in fat. In monosyllables its softened if not
        followed by m or a sharp consonant. Same in the words tenni, enni, menni, venni
        and similar ones
    * é is articulated like English's a in fate, if the assonance of e be avoided
    * i is articulated like French's i in fine
    * í is articulated like English's long e in deed
    * o is articulated like French's short o. Is the short sound of ó
    * ó is articulated like English's o in coal, loan, etc.
    * ö is articulated like French's eu in jeudi. A very deep and unclear sound of a
        short e
    * ő is articulated like German's ö in öde, höle, etc. Is the protracted sound of ö
    * u is articulated like English's u in bull
    * ú is articulated like English's long double o in food
    * ü is articulated like French's u in une, (je) fus, etc.
    * ű is articulated like German's ü in übel. Is the protracted sound of ü.
* The 24 consonants are:
    * b, cs, cz, d, f, g, gy, h, j, k, l, ly, m, n, ny, p, r, s, sz, t, ty, v, z, zs
    * B, Cs, Cz, D, F, G, Gy, H, J, K, L, Ly, M, N, Ny, P, R, S, Sz, T, Ty, V, Z, Zs
* Of which 16 are simple⁴:
    * b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, z
* And 8 are compounded⁵:
    * cs, cz, gy, ly, ny, sz, ty, zs.
* On the non-equivalent English articulations of compounded consonants⁶:
    * cz is articulated like ts in English, equal to the German z
    * gy is articulated by d followed by u as in due, duce, etc.
    * dj is articulated by d followed by y as in English
    * ly is articulated similarly to French's il, ille, etc. preceded by another vowel
        as in traveil, feuille, etc.
    * lj is articulated similarly to ly, but has been replaced by jj as in vajjon,
        instead of valljon
    * ny is articulated like in French's gne, and the English n with long u, or the n in
        new
    * ty is articulated as a sharp gy, and very nearly to the articulation of the
        consonants t and u, as in tube.
    * dzs is articulated like g in general.
* The Hungarian language requires that:
    * Each articulation and sound to be given distinctly and plainly
    * There is no muted vowel or unarticulated consonant in any word
    * Even in the ocurrence of two consonants be distinct. Each being articulated
        separately
* Here is a cheatsheet for quicker learning:

NOTE:
    ¹ By long is meant the protraction or prolongation.
    ² By short is meant contraction, or quick pronunciation of the same sound.
    ³ There is a older form accent: umlaut(?). This one is modern.
    ⁴ They have the same articulations as English. Except j who equals y as a consonant,
        s who equals to sh, g who is always hard like [g]uide, and r who always have a
        strong trill.
    ⁵ There are 3 articulations in English that are identical to Hungarian ones. cs who
        equals to [ch]apter, the sz who equals to sharp [s]even, and zs who equals to
        sei[z]ure.
    ⁶ These require training as they're not exactly equal. And thus the most difficult
        articulations are those of gy and ty. The latter being a sharp articulation of
        the former.
